# PyRPS - Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
**PyRPS** is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented in Python. The user plays against an AI that randomly selects one of the three choices. The game continues in an infinite loop until manually stopped.

---

## How It Works
1. The game prompts the user to enter **"Rock"**, **"Paper"**, or **"Scissors"**.
2. The AI randomly selects one of the three choices.
3. The program compares the user's choice with the AI's choice to determine the winner:
   - **Win:** The user beats the AI.
   - **Loss:** The AI beats the user.
   - **Tie:** Both the user and AI choose the same.
4. The game keeps track of how many times the user has played.
5. It calculates and displays the **win percentage**.
6. The game **automatically restarts** after each round.
